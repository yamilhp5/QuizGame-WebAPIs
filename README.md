# QuizGame-WebAPIs
This exercise was a self-made quiz for testing coding knowledge using WebApis.

# Description

This website is a general knowledge quiz that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts elements. The main purpose of the website is for us to practice and improve
our JavaScript language skill and integrating it with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is one of the languages used in the majority of the website for creating interactive user experience. 

I have created this website so that I could further my knowledge with and learn how to create more interactive web content such as quizzes. 

When I was creating the quiz I had the opportunity to explore more and get to know more how the language works.
